# Weather_Dashboard_05_18_2022

Description: The purpose of this weather dashboard is to demonstrate the capabilities of third party APIs and how easy and functional they can be.  Using OpenWeather One Call API, users are able to quickly and easily search for weather in there city or any other city in order to view a current forecast and an extended forecast.

Installation: this is a locally deployed application, either clone the repo and run on live server / default browser or click on the pages link listed below.

Usage: A user can enter a city of their choice to view the current and 5 day extended weather including tempurature, humidity and wind speed.  This also saves your search history to local storage and regurgitates that onto the screen below the search box

Technology - HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap.  The API is OpenWeather API
